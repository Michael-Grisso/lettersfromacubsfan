This is a repository only used for a school project.  I have an actual WP site for it, but it's just to play around with and I haven't for months.  We are required to link to a repository of a "made up" website here on GH.  If you want to check out my practice portfolio for this project you can go to https://github.com/Michael-Grisso/html-css-project.
